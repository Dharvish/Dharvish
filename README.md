- 👋 Hi, I’m @SentienceKid
- 👀 I’m interested in developing projects that can be able to help humanity. Solving issues of mental labour and issues relating to social connection.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android Development Java and I am trying my best to get my hands on variety of discipline just to understand the concepts that could help me to develop good quality products ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a variety of application as it may further my knowledge in the field and  also aids in developing passive income.
